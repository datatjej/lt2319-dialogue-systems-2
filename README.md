# Lab 2: Getting to know TDM

## Thoughts about the lab
It would be have been nice if the setting-everything-up phase could have been made more smooth somehow, since many of us spent the whole lab session just doing that. I'm still not entierly sure how all the windows we need to run relate to each other and which ones we actually need to restart in order to run the tests, so some introduction about that would have been nice. It was also quite challenging at times to understand the error messages since they wouldn't state which file the error occurred in, only the line number (especially the GF error which references files we don't even have access to). Once I got around the hurdle of syntax errors it became more fun though, and I do feel this lab has given me a better understanding for TDM.
