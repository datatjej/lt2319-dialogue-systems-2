## Thoughts about the lab
It would be nice if the setting-everything-up phase could have been made more smooth somehow. I'm still not entierly sure how all the windows 
we need to run relate to each other and which ones we actually need to restart in order to run the tests. 

It was also quite challenging at times to understand the error messages since they wouldn't state which file the error occurred in, 
only the line number (especially the GF error which references files we don't even have access to). Once I got around the hurdle
of syntax errors it became more fun though.
